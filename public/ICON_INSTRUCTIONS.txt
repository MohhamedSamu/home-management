PWA Icons Required:

You need to create two PNG icons for the PWA:
- icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons should be:
- Square images
- Simple, recognizable design
- Suitable for app icons on mobile devices

You can use any image editing tool or online generator to create these.
Once created, replace this file with your actual icon files.
